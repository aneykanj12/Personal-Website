                        <h2>About Me </h2>
                        <p>Hello! My name is Aney Kanji and I am a third year undergraduate student at Texas A&M University. I am studying Computer Science and Statistics and I am apart of my University's Engineering Honors program. From a young age, I have always been fascinated with the idea of building things. I remember fondly of my times playing with Legos and breaking stuff apart to see the inner workings of gadgets. As I got older, my curiosity for understanding the way something works only grew. Eventually I found myself dabbling in robotics and engineering, soon finding my way to Computer Science. Here in Computer Science, I feel I have found my passion which lies in machine learning and more specifically, natural language processing.</p>
                        <p>I believe AI and Machine Learning, especially Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing applications, with the help of LLMs, are going to revolutionize automation and technology. The effects are in real time and I would say is a pretty incredible thing to witness each day. Simple routine tasks have been automated to make life safer, easier, and more eficient. While most are afraid and uncertain of the growth of this field, I believe we should embrace and welcome the evolution in advancement and exploration.</p>
                        <p>Outside of my own classes, I am currently an intern at Cincinati Children's Hospital and Medical Center, researching ways to utilize AI in bioinformatics to improve healthcare. I am also a teaching assistant this Fall semester for Computational Data Science (CSCE 305) working with Dr. Wenhui Chu. Some of my hobbies that I enjoy are hanging out with friends, watching basketball, playing golf on the weekends, traveling, and ocassional reading. With my few semesters remaining at Texas A&M University, I hope to embark on new and exciting experiences, meet new people, and to try to explore more of my interests whether that be through hobbies, clubs, or community engagement!    7</p>
