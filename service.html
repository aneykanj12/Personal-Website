            <h2>My Volunteer Work</h2>
            <p>I am a firm believer in giving back to the community that has supported me. At nearly every point in my life, I've tried to volunteer and participate in service where my actions could have a positive impact on others. Regardless of the size of the event or my role, I consistently try to give back. In recent semesters, I've had the opportunity to serve as a Teaching Assistant and Peer Teacher, assisting professors and other teaching assistants in fostering a better learning environment for students from all backgrounds. I love seeing the sense of accomplishment when students succeed and solve problems, and I hope my efforts have made a positive difference in people's lives.</p>

                <h3>Round Rock Area Serving Center</h3>
                <p>
                    Back when I was in High School, a really popular place for volunteering was Round Rock Area Serving Center. 
                    This place has a very strong community and love giving back. That is why I loved working there over the Summer.
                    From the people we were able to help, down to the new connections I made, I really enjoyed this experience.
                    At some point in the near future, I would like to eventually go back to pay my services once again!

                <h3>Innerview Opportunities</h3>
                <p>
                    As any kid in High School, I was also a part of my school's National Honor Society.
                    When I first joined, I mostly did it for College apps, however as time in the club went on, I soon realized there was more to this society than I knew.
                    National Honor Society taught me that a large proportion of being an "honor" student is going above and beyond for others, making an impact on others, and giving back.
                    Thanks to the connections through Innerview, I was able to do multiple canned-food drives, babysitting gigs, and much more.
